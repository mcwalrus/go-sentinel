M: Hey Claude, I was wondering about building an open-source module which read provides routine handling which exports metrics directly as prom about success. Are there any go libraries which perform this already?


Yes, there are several Go libraries that can help you build modules with Prometheus metrics for routine handling and success tracking. Here are some popular options:
Direct Prometheus Libraries
prometheus/client_golang - The official Prometheus client library for Go. This is the most common choice and provides:

Counter, Gauge, Histogram, and Summary metric types
Built-in HTTP handler for /metrics endpoint
Easy integration with existing applications

prometheus/promauto - Part of the official client, provides automatic metric registration
Higher-Level Libraries with Built-in Metrics
go-kit/kit - A microservices toolkit that includes:

Built-in Prometheus metrics middleware
Request counting, latency histograms, and error tracking
Easy wrapping of service methods

grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-prometheus - If you're building gRPC services, this provides automatic metrics for:

Request/response counts
Request duration
Error rates

Middleware/Wrapper Libraries
prometheus/promhttp - HTTP middleware for automatic request metrics
labstack/echo-prometheus - If using Echo framework
For a simple routine success tracking module, you'd typically start with the official prometheus/client_golang library and create counters for successes/failures and histograms for duration. Would you like me to show you a basic example of how to structure such a module?


Could you explain the purpose of promauto with an example? I don't quite understand the purpose of itEditGreat question! promauto is a convenience package that automatically registers metrics with the default Prometheus registry when you create them. Let me show you the difference with examples.
Without promauto (manual registration)
gopackage main

import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    // Create a counter manually
    requestsTotal := prometheus.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "http_requests_total",
            Help: "Total number of HTTP requests",
        },
        []string{"method", "endpoint"},
    )
    
    // You MUST manually register it with the registry
    prometheus.MustRegister(requestsTotal)
    
    // Now you can use it
    requestsTotal.WithLabelValues("GET", "/api/users").Inc()
    
    // Expose metrics endpoint
    http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
With promauto (automatic registration)
gopackage main

import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promauto"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
    "net/http"
)

var (
    // This counter is automatically registered when created
    requestsTotal = promauto.NewCounterVec(
        prometheus.CounterOpts{
            Name: "http_requests_total",
            Help: "Total number of HTTP requests",
        },
        []string{"method", "endpoint"},
    )
)

func main() {
    // No need to call prometheus.MustRegister() - it's already registered!
    requestsTotal.WithLabelValues("GET", "/api/users").Inc()
    
    http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

Common Pattern for Libraries/Modules

package mymodule

import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promauto"
    "time"
)

var (
    // These are automatically registered when the package is imported
    routineSuccessTotal = promauto.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "mymodule_routine_success_total",
        Help: "Total number of successful routine executions",
    })
    
    routineFailureTotal = promauto.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
        Name: "mymodule_routine_failure_total", 
        Help: "Total number of failed routine executions",
    })
    
    routineDuration = promauto.NewHistogram(prometheus.HistogramOpts{
        Name: "mymodule_routine_duration_seconds",
        Help: "Duration of routine executions in seconds",
    })
)

func DoWork() error {
    start := time.Now()
    defer routineDuration.Observe(time.Since(start).Seconds())
    
    // Do your work here...
    if err := someWork(); err != nil {
        routineFailureTotal.Inc()
        return err
    }
    
    routineSuccessTotal.Inc()
    return nil
}


The Key Benefits of promauto

Less boilerplate: No need to remember prometheus.MustRegister()
Prevents registration errors: Can't forget to register or accidentally register twice
Cleaner global metrics: Perfect for package-level metric variables
Same functionality: Uses the exact same metric types under the hood

The main advantage is simplicity - promauto handles the registration automatically so you can focus on using the metrics rather than managing their lifecycle.

M: I want to provide a new library which registers metrics to core methods in API applications, loops in long running services, to observe time taken, success, failures, panics, etc in a way that can be dropped in place. Could you provide direct feedback on the application of the idea?

This is a solid idea with real market demand! Here's my direct feedback:

## Strong Value Proposition
- **Pain point exists**: Manual instrumentation is tedious and often inconsistent across teams
- **Clear ROI**: Observability is critical but time-consuming to implement properly
- **Good timing**: Go ecosystem loves drop-in middleware/decorators

## Design Considerations

**API Methods**: This works well - HTTP middleware patterns are well-established in Go. You can easily wrap handlers and extract route patterns, status codes, etc.

**Long-running loops**: This is trickier. You'll need to decide:
- How do users mark loop iterations? (context, explicit calls, or magic?)
- How do you handle nested loops or complex control flow?
- What constitutes a "failure" in a loop vs just continuing?

**Panic recovery**: Great addition - many teams forget this. You can use `recover()` to catch panics and increment failure counters.

## Potential Challenges

1. **Magic vs Explicit**: Too much magic (automatic detection) can be confusing. Too explicit defeats the "drop-in" goal.

2. **Performance overhead**: Timing every operation adds latency. Consider sampling or opt-out mechanisms for hot paths.

3. **Label cardinality explosion**: If you auto-generate labels from function names, HTTP routes, etc., you could create too many metric series.

4. **Configuration**: Different teams want different histogram buckets, label sets, metric naming conventions.

## Recommended Approach

Start with **HTTP middleware** - it's the easiest win:
```go
router.Use(yourlib.PrometheusMiddleware())
```

Then add **explicit decorators** for functions:
```go
func MyService() error {
    return yourlib.TrackExecution("my_service", func() error {
        // actual work
    })
}
```

The loop instrumentation is the hardest part - consider making it explicit rather than automatic.

This could definitely gain adoption if executed well. The Go community values pragmatic, non-intrusive tooling.





M: Focusing on long running services, what would be the core methods useful to deliver an API?

For long-running services, here are the core methods that would provide the most value in a drop-in instrumentation library:

## Essential Methods

**1. Loop/Worker Instrumentation**
```go
// For background workers, cron jobs, message processors
func TrackLoop(name string, fn func() error) error
func TrackWorker(name string, batchSize int, fn func() error) error
```

**2. External Dependency Calls**
```go
// Database, HTTP clients, message queues, etc.
func TrackDependency(service, operation string, fn func() error) error
func TrackQuery(database, table string, fn func() error) error
```

**3. Critical Business Operations**
```go
// Core business logic that must be monitored
func TrackOperation(operation string, fn func() error) error
func TrackTransaction(txType string, fn func() error) error
```

**4. Resource Management**
```go
// Connection pools, file handles, memory usage
func TrackResource(resource string, current, max int)
func TrackHealthCheck(service string, fn func() error) error
```

## Key Metrics Each Method Should Capture

- **Duration histograms** (with sensible buckets: 10ms, 100ms, 1s, 10s, etc.)
- **Success/failure counters**
- **Active operations gauge** (how many currently running)
- **Panic counter** with recovery
- **Rate limiting/throttling indicators**

## Service-Specific Patterns

**Message Processing Services:**
```go
TrackMessageProcessor("order_processor", func() error {
    // process message
})
```

**Data Pipeline Services:**
```go
TrackBatchJob("etl_users", batchSize, func() error {
    // process batch
})
```

**API Gateway/Proxy Services:**
```go
TrackUpstreamCall("user_service", "GET /users", func() error {
    // make upstream call
})
```

## Configuration API
```go
type Config struct {
    Namespace     string              // metric prefix
    DefaultLabels map[string]string   // service, version, etc.
    Buckets       []float64          // custom histogram buckets
    SampleRate    float64            // for high-volume operations
}
```

The key insight is that long-running services have **predictable patterns** - they're usually processing things in loops, calling external systems, and performing business operations. Focus on these patterns rather than trying to instrument arbitrary code paths.


M: Can you explain considerations of the prometheus/client_golang that are worth considering with implementing customisability with an API. I'm thinking of prom labels, etc.

Great question! The Prometheus client has some important constraints and design patterns that will significantly impact your library's API design. Here are the key considerations:

## Label Cardinality - The Big One

**Problem**: Prometheus creates a separate time series for each unique combination of label values. This can explode quickly.

```go
// BAD - Could create millions of series
requestsTotal.WithLabelValues(userID, requestID, timestamp) // DON'T DO THIS

// GOOD - Bounded cardinality  
requestsTotal.WithLabelValues(method, statusCode, endpoint) // Limited combinations
```

**API Design Impact**: Your library needs to:
- Provide sensible default labels
- Allow users to opt into additional labels
- Warn about high-cardinality labels

```go
type Config struct {
    // Safe defaults
    DefaultLabels []string // ["method", "status"] 
    
    // Opt-in dangerous labels
    HighCardinalityLabels []string // ["user_id"] - user must explicitly enable
    
    // Label value limits
    MaxLabelValues map[string]int // "endpoint": 100 (truncate after 100 unique endpoints)
}
```

## Metric Registration - One-Time Only

**Problem**: Prometheus metrics must be registered once with consistent label names. You can't change labels later.

```go
// This will panic if called twice with different labels
counter := prometheus.NewCounterVec(opts, []string{"method"})
prometheus.MustRegister(counter)

counter2 := prometheus.NewCounterVec(opts, []string{"method", "user"}) // PANIC!
```

**API Design Impact**: 
- Determine all possible labels at library initialization
- Use lazy registration or builder patterns
- Consider metric families vs individual metrics

```go
// Good pattern - configure once, use everywhere
lib := yourlib.New(Config{
    Labels: []string{"operation", "status", "service"},
})

// All operations use the same label structure
lib.TrackOperation("user_create", func() error { ... })
lib.TrackOperation("order_process", func() error { ... })
```

## Label Value Constraints

**Prometheus Requirements**:
- Label names must match `[a-zA-Z_:][a-zA-Z0-9_:]*`
- Label values can be any UTF-8 string but should be bounded
- Empty label values are allowed but not recommended

```go
// Your library should sanitize labels
func sanitizeLabelValue(value string) string {
    if len(value) > 64 { // Reasonable limit
        value = value[:64]
    }
    // Replace problematic characters
    return strings.ReplaceAll(value, " ", "_")
}
```

## Histogram Buckets - Set Once

**Problem**: Histogram buckets are defined at creation and can't be changed.

```go
// These buckets apply to ALL observations of this metric
histogram := prometheus.NewHistogram(prometheus.HistogramOpts{
    Buckets: []float64{0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100}, // seconds
})
```

**API Design Impact**:
```go
type Config struct {
    // Different operations might need different buckets
    HistogramBuckets map[string][]float64{
        "http_request": {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5},      // fast operations
        "batch_job":    {1, 10, 60, 300, 1800},        // slow operations  
        "database":     {0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10},     // db queries
    }
}
```

## Metric Naming Conventions

Prometheus has strong naming conventions:
- `_total` suffix for counters
- `_seconds` for time measurements
- Base unit should be seconds, bytes, etc.

```go
// Your library should enforce good naming
func (c *Config) metricName(operation, metricType string) string {
    base := fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s_%s", c.Namespace, operation, metricType)
    
    switch metricType {
    case "counter":
        return base + "_total"
    case "duration": 
        return base + "_seconds"
    case "size":
        return base + "_bytes"
    }
    return base
}
```

## Practical API Design Example

```go
type Instrumenter struct {
    config Config
    metrics map[string]*metricSet // cached metric families
}

type metricSet struct {
    duration prometheus.HistogramVec
    counter  prometheus.CounterVec
    active   prometheus.GaugeVec
}

func New(config Config) *Instrumenter {
    // Validate configuration
    if err := validateLabels(config.Labels); err != nil {
        panic(err) // Fail fast on invalid config
    }
    
    return &Instrumenter{
        config: config,
        metrics: make(map[string]*metricSet),
    }
}

func (i *Instrumenter) TrackOperation(name string, labels prometheus.Labels, fn func() error) error {
    metrics := i.getOrCreateMetrics(name)
    
    // Sanitize label values
    cleanLabels := i.sanitizeLabels(labels)
    
    start := time.Now()
    metrics.active.With(cleanLabels).Inc()
    defer metrics.active.With(cleanLabels).Dec()
    
    err := fn()
    
    metrics.duration.With(cleanLabels).Observe(time.Since(start).Seconds())
    
    status := "success"
    if err != nil {
        status = "error"
    }
    cleanLabels["status"] = status
    metrics.counter.With(cleanLabels).Inc()
    
    return err
}
```

The key is to make the dangerous parts (cardinality, registration) explicit in your configuration while keeping the usage simple and safe by default.
