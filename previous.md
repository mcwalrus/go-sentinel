# Sentinel

Sentinel provides reliability with observability monitoring for tasks in Go applications. It wraps task execution with Prometheus metrics, error handling, retries, and timeouts â€” making background jobs and goroutines safe, measurable, and reliable.


sentinel_in_flight	Current number of running tasks
sentinel_success_total	Counter of successful task completions
sentinel_errors_total	Counter of failed tasks
sentinel_timeout_total	Counter of timed-out tasks
sentinel_panics_total	Counter of panics recovered in tasks
sentinel_runtime_seconds	Histogram of task execution durations
sentinel_retries_total	Counter of retries attempted


Roadmap:

[-] Labels support, Vec support.
[-] Curcuit breaker with supported prom metrics.

# taskscope

Provides task reliability features and observability monitoring via exported Prometheus metrics.    

Features

1. Prometheus metrics of tasks / jobs.
3. Visibility of task / job errors.
4. Provides retry strategies and timeouts.

Go routines return errors, if an error occurs within a routine, the reliablity handler will notify the promthesus endpoint.

Promthesus metrics:

- In Flight
- Successes
- Error count
- Timeout Errors
- Panics Occurances
- Routine Runtime Histogram
- Retries

Retries can be configured per worker. These are useful.
